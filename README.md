## ðŸ“Š Projects Overview
# 1. Walmart Sales Forecasting

Built time series models to forecast weekly sales across different Walmart stores and departments. The project involved feature engineering (like lag features) and model evaluation for sales prediction accuracy.

# 2. Loan Approval Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict loan approval likelihood based on applicant financial and demographic data. Implemented preprocessing with one-hot encoding, feature selection, and classification algorithms.

# 3. Movie Recommendation System

Implemented an item-based collaborative filtering system to recommend movies based on user preferences. Evaluated using precision@k and similarity matrices.

# 4. Traffic Signal Simulation

Designed a traffic light system simulation using Python and graphics programming concepts. Explored scheduling logic and real-world assumptions about traffic flow management.

# 5. Student Score Prediction

Created regression models to predict students' exam scores based on study hours, attendance, sleep hours, and previous performance. Compared multiple models and improved accuracy with feature engineering and categorical encoding.

# 6. Customer Data Segmentation

Performed clustering analysis on customer data to segment them into distinct groups. Used techniques like K-Means clustering for identifying customer behavior patterns for targeted marketing strategies.
